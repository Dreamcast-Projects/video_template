# video_template
This serves as template C code layout for adding different video decoding/streaming support to the Sega Dreamcast

format.h/c should be replaced by the video format decoder you are going to implement.  The video decoder you implement should at least have the ability to execute these functions.

For a sample of this actually being used checkout this project: https://github.com/Dreamcast-Projects/dreamroq. (roq-player.h/c. dreamroqlib.h/c)
